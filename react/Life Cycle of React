Life Cycle of React

We want to set up a timer whenever the Clock is rendered to the DOM for the first time. This is called “mounting” in React.

We also want to clear that timer whenever the DOM produced by the Clock is removed. This is called “unmounting” in React.

Mounting : when instance of a component is created and inserted into a DOM element
Methods -> construcor, static getDerivedStateFromProps, render and componentDidMount.

The componentDidMount() method runs after the component output has been rendered to the DOM. This is a good place to set up a timer:


Updating : when a component is being re-rendering as a result of changes to its probs or state.
Methods -> static getDerivedStateFromProps, shouldComponentUpdate, render, getSnapshotBeforeUpdate and componentDidUpdate.

Unmounting :  when a component is being removed from from a DOM.
Methods -> componentWillUnmount

Error Handling : When their is an error during rendering, in a lifecycle method, or in a constructor of any of the child omponent.
Methods -> static getDerivedStateFromError, componentDidCatch
