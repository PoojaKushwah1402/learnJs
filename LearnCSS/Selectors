Selectors

CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) the HTML elements you want to style.

We can divide CSS selectors into five categories:

-> Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)

-> Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)
   four type :
    		--DISCENDENT SELECTORS.
    		--Direct child selectors (div > p{})
    		--Adjecent sibling selecot (div + p{})
    		--general sibling selector (h2 ~ p {})
 
 DISCENDENT SELECTORS :-
 this can contain parent->child rellationship or grandparent->parent->child etc.

 eg. div .hello p{
 	here that element will be styleed which is in P and which P is inside class HELLO and which hello class is in DIV.
 }


-> Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)

Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element)

-> Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)
it contains 4-5 properties :-

The [attribute="value"] selector is used to select elements with a specified attribute and value.
he [attribute~="value"] selector is used to select elements with an attribute value containing a specified word.
The [attribute^="value"] selector is used to select elements whose attribute value begins with a specified value.
The [attribute$="value"] selector is used to select elements whose attribute value ends with a specified value.
The [attribute*="value"] selector is used to select elements whose attribute value contains a specified value.
