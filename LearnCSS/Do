Do :
 
1. Shadow DOM 
2.psudo elements.

-> 3.css triangles
 with the border property we can easily make triangle. 

-> 4.data attributes :-

Any attribute on any element whose attribute name starts with data- is a data attribute. Say you have an article and you want to store some extra information that doesnâ€™t have any visual representation. Just use data attributes for that:
<article
  id="electric-cars"
  data-columns="3"
  data-index-number="12314"
  data-parent="cars">
...
</article>

To get a data attribute through the dataset object, get the property by the part of the attribute name after data- (note that dashes are converted to camelCase).

const article = document.querySelector('#electric-cars');
 
article.dataset.columns // "3"
Note that, as data attributes are plain HTML attributes, you can even access them from CSS. For example to show the parent data on the article you can use generated content in CSS with the attr() function:

article::before {
  content: attr(data-parent);
}
You can also use the attribute selectors in CSS to change styles according to the data:

article[data-columns='3'] {
  width: 400px;}

-> 5. Difference between body and universal selector.
