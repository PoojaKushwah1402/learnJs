MediaQuery


The @media rule, introduced in CSS2, made it possible to define different style rules for different media types.

Examples: You could have one set of style rules for computer screens, one for printers, one for handheld devices, one for television-type devices, and so on.
Using media queries are a popular technique for delivering a tailored style sheet to desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile phones (such as iPhone and Android phones).

syntax:
@media not|only mediatype and (expressions) {
  CSS-Code;
}

@media screen and (min-width: 480px) {
  body {
    background-color: lightgreen;
  }
}

The following example changes the background-color to lightgreen if the viewport is 480 pixels wide or wider (if the viewport is less than 480 pixels, the background-color will be pink):



You can also use the (max-width: ..) and (min-width: ..) values to set a minimum width and a maximum width.

For example, when the browser's width is between 600 and 900px, change the appearance of a <div> element:


@media screen and (max-width: 900px) and (min-width: 600px) {
  div.example {
    font-size: 50px;
    padding: 50px;
    border: 8px solid black;
    background: yellow;
  }
}
