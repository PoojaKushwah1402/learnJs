CSS(DISPLAY) :

The display property specifies if/how an element is displayed.

Every HTML element has a default display value depending on what type of element it is. The default display value for most elements is block or inline.

CSS DISPLAY property has multiple valaues :
-None, -Inline, -Inline-Block, -Block, -List-item, -Flex, -Grid, -inline-Flex, -inline-Grid, -Table, -inline-Table, -Table-row, -Table-cell, -Table-column, -Table-caption, -Table-column-group, -Table-row-group, -Table-header-group, -Table-footer-group, -Run-in, -Contents.

: NONE - 
none is used to hide the content or its space from the DOM.

: BLOCK - 
A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).
margin, padding and other properties work properly on block element.

: INLINE - 
Inline -level element takes width as much as needed. and aligned in a single line untile it fulls. margin , padding mostly dont work properly, and genreally margin works only left and right .(it doesnt matter how much width you give it wont change).
why margin-top/bottom, height,width doesnt work in this.

: INLINE-BLOCK - 
this property works combination of both. like if you want multiple element on same line but want to give them margin , padding height, width then this property will be used.
this property works same as block but nit move every other element to next line, but only shifts to next line when needed(as in INLINE.)

: LIST-ITEM -
when you set this property then it will work as unordered list. and also. we can style with other list property now, as this becomes list.

: FLEX -

: GRID -
