//STRING

slice() --- extracts a part of a string and returns the extracted part in a new string.
          If a parameter is negative, the position is counted from the end of the string.
          If you omit the second parameter, substr() will slice out the rest of the string.

substring() is similar to slice().
            The difference is that substring() cannot accept negative indexes.
            If you omit the second parameter, substr() will slice out the rest of the string.

substr() is similar to slice().

            The difference is that the second parameter specifies the length of the extracted part.
            If you omit the second parameter, substr() will slice out the rest of the string.
            If the first parameter is negative, the position counts from the end of the string.

The replace() method replaces a specified value with another value in a string:
            The replace() method does not change the string it is called on. It returns a new string.

The concat() method can be used instead of the plus operator. These two lines do the same:

The trim() method removes whitespace from both sides of a string:

The charAt() method returns the character at a specified index (position) in a string:
