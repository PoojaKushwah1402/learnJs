WEBWORKER :-
web worker provides a way to perform some thing in background which doesnt affect your UI.
some function can be complex calculation. or somthing that can take time due to complexness. so we can perform them in background.
webworker uses methods like postmessage and onmessage to communicate(between page and worker).
As webworker executes in seperate thread it does not have access to DOM element like parent or anything.
you can also terminate the worker using x.termineworker().
